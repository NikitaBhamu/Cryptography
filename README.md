This folder contains all the assignment of the course COL759 : "Cryptography &amp; Computer Security"

## Assignment 1 :  
### Encyption, Decryption & Analysis of Hill Cipher
encrypt.py :- This file contains the method to encrypt the plaintext by the key using the Hill Cipher algorithm.<br />
decrypt.py :- This file contains the method to decrypt the ciphertext by the key using the Hill Cipher algorithm.<br />
analysis.py :- This file contains the method to use the Index Of Coincidence of the english language to get the complete plaintext from the known plaintext attack, where the plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext of size n^2 (where n is the size of the key) is known.<br />
